<h2>
An Overview of the File Transfer Protocol</h2>
<p>The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) was one of the first efforts to create a
standard means of exchanging files over a TCP/IP network, so the FTP has been
around since the 1970's.&nbsp; The FTP was designed with as much flexibility as
possible, so it could be used over networks other than TCP/IP, as well as being
engineered to have the capability with exchanging files with a broad variety of
machines.</p>
<p>The base specification is <a href="http://www.ncftp.com/ncftp/rfc959.html">RFC
959</a> and is dated October 1985.&nbsp; There are some additional RFCs relating
to FTP, but it should be noted that even as of this writing (December 2001) that
most of the new additions are not in widespread use.&nbsp; The purpose of this
document is to provide general information about how the protocol works without
getting into too many technical details.&nbsp; RFC 959 should be consulted for
details on the protocol.</p>
<h4>Control Connection -- the conversation channel</h4>
<p>The protocol can be thought of as interactive, because clients and servers
actually have a conversation where they authenticate themselves and negotiate
file transfers.&nbsp; In addition, the protocol specifies that the client and
server do not exchange data on the conversation channel.&nbsp; Instead, clients
and servers negotiate how to send data files on separate connections, with one
connection for each data transfer.&nbsp; Note that a directory listing is
considered a file transfer.</p>
<p>To illustrate, we'll just present (an admittedly contrived) example of how
the FTP would work between human beings rather than computer systems.&nbsp; For
our example, we'll assume we have a client, Carl <b>Clinton</b>, who wishes to
transfer files from Acme Mail <b>Service</b>  that manages his post office
box.&nbsp; Below is a transcript of a phone call between Carl Clinton and Acme
Mail Service.</p>

<p>As you can see, FTP is designed to allow users to browse the filesystem much
like you would with a regular UNIX&nbsp; login shell or MS-DOS command
prompt.&nbsp; This differs from other protocols that are transactional (i.e.
HTTP), where a connection is established, clients issue a single message to a
server that replies with a single reply, and the connection is closed.&nbsp; On
the other hand, client programs can be constructed to simulate a transactional
environment if they know in advance what they need to do.&nbsp; In effect, FTP
is a stateful sequence of one or more transactions.
</p>
<h4>Command primitives, result codes and textual responses
</h4>
<p>The client is always responsible for initiating requests.&nbsp; These
requests are issued with FTP command primitives, which are typically 3 or 4
characters each.&nbsp; For example, the command primitive to change the working
directory is <tt>CWD</tt>.
</p>
<p>The server replies are specially formatted to contain a 3-digit result code
first, followed by a space character, followed by descriptive text (there is
also a format for multi-line responses).&nbsp; The protocol specifies that
clients must only rely upon the numeric result code, since the descriptive text
is allowed to vary (with a few exceptions).&nbsp; In practice, the result text
is often helpful for debugging, but is generally no longer useful for end users.
</p>
<h4>Authentication
</h4>
<p>Although it is not required by protocol, in effect clients must always login
to the FTP server with a username and password before the server will allow the
client to access the service.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>There is also a de facto standard for guest access, where &quot;<tt>anonymous</tt>&quot;
(or &quot;<tt>ftp</tt>&quot;) are used as the username and an e-mail address is
customarily used as the password in a way for a polite netizen to let the server
administrator know who is using the guest login.&nbsp; Because users do not want
to divulge their e-mail addresses to protect against unsolicited bulk e-mail,
this has subsequently evolved to the point where the password is just some
arbitrary text.
</p>
<h4>Types of data connections
</h4>
<p>The protocol has built-in support for different types of data
transfers.&nbsp; The two mandated types are ASCII for text (specified by the
client sending &quot;<tt>TYPE A</tt>&quot; to the server), and &quot;image&quot;
for binary data (specified by &quot;<tt>TYPE I</tt>&quot;).
</p>
<p>ASCII transfers are useful when the server machine and client machine have
different standards for text.&nbsp; For example, MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows
use a carriage return and linefeed sequence to denote an end-of-line, but UNIX
systems use just a linefeed.&nbsp; When ASCII transfers are specified, this
enables a client to always be able to translate the data into its own native
text format.
</p>
<p>Binary transfers can be used for any type of raw data that requires no
translation.&nbsp; Client programs should use binary transfers unless they know
that the file in question is text.
</p>
<p>The protocol does not have any advanced support for character sets for
pathnames nor file contents.&nbsp; There is no way to specify UNICODE, for
example.&nbsp; For ASCII, it is 7-bit ASCII only.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the burden of deciding what transfer type to use is left to
the client, unlike HTTP, which can inform the client what type of data is being
sent.&nbsp; Clients often simply choose to transfer everything in binary, and
perform any necessary translation after the file is downloaded.&nbsp;
Additionally, binary transfers are inherently more efficient to send over the
network since the client and server do not need to perform on-the-fly
translation of the data.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that ASCII transfers are mandated by the protocol as the
default transfer type unless the client requests otherwise!

<h4>The PORT and PASV conundrum -- Active and Passive data connections
</h4>
<p>Although it was purposely designed into the protocol as a feature, FTP's use
of <a href="http://www.ncftp.com/ncftpd/doc/misc/ftp_and_firewalls.html"> separate data connections cause numerous problems for things like firewalls,
routers, proxies</a> which want to restrict or delegate TCP connections, as well as
things like IP stacks which want to do dynamic stateful inspection of TCP
connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The protocol does not mandate a particular port number or a direction that a
data connection uses.&nbsp; For example, the easy way out would have been for
the protocol's designers to mandate that <i> all</i> data connections must originate
from the client machine and terminate at port 20 on the server machine.
</p>
<p>Instead, for maximum flexibility, the protocol allows the client to choose
one of two methods.&nbsp; The first method, which we'll call &quot;<b>Active</b>&quot;,
is where the client requests that the server originate
a data connection and terminate at an IP address and port number of the client's
choosing.&nbsp; The important thing to note here is that the s<i>erver connects
out to the client</i>.
</p>
<ul>
<table cellSpacing="4" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td vAlign="baseline" align="right" width="40"><b>Client:</b></td>
    <td vAlign="baseline" width="450"><font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Please
      connect to me at port 1931 on IP address 192.168.1.2, then send the data.&quot;</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td vAlign="baseline" align="right" width="40"><b>Server:</b></td>
    <td vAlign="baseline" width="450"><font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;OK&quot;</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</ul>
<p>Or, the client can request that the server to assign an IP address and port
number on the server side and have the client originate a connection to the
server address.&nbsp; We call this method &quot;<b>Passive</b>&quot; and note
that the <i>client connects out to the server</i>.
</p>
<ul>
<table cellSpacing="4" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td vAlign="baseline" align="right" width="40"><b>Client:</b></td>
    <td vAlign="baseline" width="450"><font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Please
      tell me where I can get the data.&quot;</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td vAlign="baseline" align="right" width="40"><b>Server:</b></td>
    <td vAlign="baseline" width="450"><font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Connect
      to me at port 4023 on 172.16.62.36.&quot;</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</ul>
<p>The active method uses the FTP command primitive <tt>PORT</tt>, so the first example
using the actual FTP protocol would resemble this:
</p>
<ul>
    <table cellSpacing="4" border="0">
        <tr>
          <td vAlign="baseline" align="right" width="40"><b>Client:</b></td>
          <td vAlign="baseline" width="450"><font face="Courier New" size="2">PORT
            192,168,1,2,7,139</font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td vAlign="baseline" align="right" width="40"><b>Server:</b></td>
          <td vAlign="baseline" width="450"><font face="Courier New" size="2">200
            PORT command successful.</font></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</ul>
<p>The passive method uses the FTP command primitive <tt>PASV</tt>, so the second example
using the actual FTP protocol would resemble this:
</p>
<ul>
    <table cellSpacing="4" border="0">
        <tr>
          <td vAlign="baseline" align="right" width="40"><b>Client:</b></td>
          <td vAlign="baseline" width="450"><font face="Courier New" size="2">PASV</font></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td vAlign="baseline" align="right" width="40"><b>Server:</b></td>
          <td vAlign="baseline" width="450"><font face="Courier New" size="2">Entering Passive Mode
            (172,16,62,36,133,111)</font></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that FTP servers are required to implement <tt>PORT</tt>,
but are not required to implement <tt>PASV</tt>.&nbsp; The default has
traditionally been <tt>PORT</tt> for this reason, but in practice it is now
preferred to use <tt>PASV</tt> whenever possible because firewalls may be
present on the client side which <a href="http://www.ncftp.com/ncftpd/doc/misc/ftp_and_firewalls.html">often
cause problems</a>.
</p>
<h4>Partial data connections -- resuming downloads
</h4>
<p>The protocol provides a means to only transfer a portion of a file, by having
a client specify a starting offset into the file (using the <tt>REST</tt>
primitive, i.e. &quot;restart point&quot;).&nbsp; If an FTP session fails while
a data transfer is in progress and has to be reestablished, a client can request
that the server restart the transfer at the offset the client specifies.&nbsp;
Note that not all FTP servers support this feature.
</p>
<h4>Directory listings
</h4>
<p>The base standard of the FTP protocol provides two types of listings, a
simple name list (<tt>NLST</tt>) and a human-readable extended listing (<tt>LIST</tt>).&nbsp;
The name list consists of lines of text, where each line contains exactly one
file name and nothing else.
</p>
<p>The extended listing is not intended to be machine-readable and the protocol
does not mandate any particular format.&nbsp; The de facto standard is for it to
be in UNIX &quot;<tt>/bin/ls -l</tt>&quot; format, but although most servers try
to emulate that format even on non-UNIX FTP servers, it is still common for
servers to provide their own proprietary format.&nbsp; The important thing to
note here is that this listing can contain any type of data and cannot be relied
upon.&nbsp; Additionally, even those that appear in &quot;<tt>/bin/ls -l</tt>&quot;
format cannot be relied upon for the validity of the fields.&nbsp; For example
the date and time could be in local time or GMT.
</p>
<p>Newer FTP server implementations support a machine-readable listing primitive
(<tt>MLSD</tt>) which is suitable for client programs to get reliable metadata
information about files, but this feature is still relatively rare.&nbsp; That
leaves the simple name list as the only reliable way to get filenames, but it
doesn't tell a client program anything else (such as if the item is a file or a
directory!).
</p>
<h4>Functional concerns
</h4>
<p>Despite a rich feature set, there are some glaring omissions.&nbsp; For
example, the base specification doesn't even provide for clients to query a
file's size or modification date.&nbsp; However, most FTP servers in use now
support a de facto extension to the specification which provides the <tt>SIZE</tt>
and <tt>MDTM</tt> primitives, and even newer servers support the extremely
useful <tt>MLSD</tt> and <tt>MSLT</tt> primitives which can provide a wealth of
information in a standardized format.
</p>
<p>There is also no 100% accurate way for a client to determine if a particular
pathname refers to a file or directory, unless <tt>MLSD</tt> or <tt>MLST</tt> is
available.&nbsp; Since the protocol also does not provide a way to transfer an
entire directory of items at once, the consequence is that there is no 100%
accurate way to download an entire directory tree.
</p>
<p>The end result is that FTP is not particularly suited to
&quot;mirroring&quot; files and directories, although FTP client programs use
heuristics to make calculated guesses when possible.
</p>
<p>Despite the guesswork that clients can use for determining metadata for files
to download, there's little they can do for files that they upload.&nbsp; There
is no standard way to preserve an uploaded file's modification time.&nbsp; FTP
is platform agnostic, so there aren't standard ways to preserve
platform-specific metadata such as UNIX permissions and user IDs or Mac OS file
type and creator codes.
</p>
<p>Separate connections for data transfers are also a mixed blessing.&nbsp; For
high performance it would be best to use a single connection and perform
multiple data transfers before closing it.&nbsp; Even better would be for a
method to use a single connection for both the control connection conversation
and data transfers.&nbsp; Since each data connection uses an ephemeral (random)
port number, it is possible to &quot;run out&quot; of connections.&nbsp; For
details on this phenomenon, a separate <a href="http://www.ncftp.com/ncftpd/doc/misc/ephemeral_ports.html">article</a>
is available.
</p>
<h4>Security concerns
</h4>
<p>It is important to note that the base specification, as implemented by the
vast majority of the world's FTP servers, does not have any special handling for
encrypted communication of any kind.&nbsp; When clients login to FTP servers,
they are sending clear text usernames and passwords!&nbsp; This means that
anyone with a packet sniffer between the client and server could surreptitiously
steal passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Besides passwords, potential attackers could not only monitor the entire
conversation on the FTP control connection, they could also monitor the contents
of the data transfers themselves.
</p>
<p>There have been proposals to make the FTP protocol more secure, but these
proposals have not seen widespread adoption.
</p>
<p>Therefore, unless the IP protocol layer itself is secure (for example,
encrypted using IPsec), FTP should not be used if sensitive login information is
to be exchanged over an insecure network, or if the files containing sensitive
material are being transferred over an insecure network.
